# NMLab final project : Housing Agency System

## How to run the project?

### Server
It is required to install some libraries on your computer in advance. (ex.numpy, ecdsa... )
First, we should open the control panel of servers.
```bash
$ cd control_panel
$ bash run.sh
```

Then open four terminals to run four servers (which should be set by real estate agents).
```bash
$ cd real_estate_agents
$ bash run1.sh
```
```bash
$ cd real_estate_agents
$ bash run2.sh
```
```bash
$ cd real_estate_agents
$ bash run3.sh
```
```bash
$ cd real_estate_agents
$ bash run4.sh
```

### Client
If the client and server are not on the same host, we should change the 'HOST' into server's fixed IP address in client/client.py <br>
Before going down, install **Flask** first !!

* Run Backend
```bash
$ flask run 
```

* Run Frontend
```bash
$ cd react-frontend
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
And then you can browse our website!
